  "text": " Great question! This touches on an important aspect of software architecture and testing strategy. The answer depends on your specific needs, but I'll provide some guidance:\n\n1. Testing the Domain Layer (Contract):\n\nTesting the abstract `Repository` in the domain layer is typically done through integration tests or when testing use cases/interactors that depend on this contract. You're not testing the implementation here, but rather how other parts of your system interact with this contract.\n\nPros:\n- Ensures that the contract is usable and meets the needs of the domain layer.\n- Can catch issues in the contract design early.\n\nCons:\n- Doesn't test actual implementation details.\n- Requires more setup as you need to create mock implementations.\n\n2. Testing the Data Layer (Implementation):\n\nTesting the `NotionRepository` in the data layer directly tests the concrete implementation of the contract.\n\nPros:\n- Directly tests the actual implementation that will be used in the app.\n- Can catch implementation-specific bugs and edge cases.\n- Easier to set up and mock external dependencies (like the API client).\n\nCons:\n- Might miss issues related to how the contract is used by other parts of the system.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIn most cases, I would recommend focusing your unit tests on the data layer implementation (`NotionRepository`). Here's why:\n\n1. It's the actual code that will run in your application.\n2. It's where the complex logic of interacting with the API and handling errors occurs.\n3. It's easier to mock the dependencies and test various scenarios.\n\nHowever, it's also valuable to have some tests at the domain layer, particularly in the form of integration tests or use case tests. These ensure that the contract is being used correctly by the rest of your application.\n\nHere's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Write detailed unit tests for `NotionRepository` as we did in the previous examples.\n\n2. Write integration tests or use case tests that use the `Repository` contract. These would typically be in a separate test suite and might look something like this:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  late Repository repository;\n  late MockUseCase mockUseCase;\n\n  setUp(() {\n    repository = MockRepository(); // A test double implementing Repository\n    mockUseCase = MockUseCase(repository);\n  });\n\n  test('UseCase correctly uses Repository contract', () async {\n    // Arrange\n    final databaseId = DatabaseId('test_id');\n    when(() => repository.getProperties(databaseId))\n        .thenAnswer((_) async => AsyncResult.success(Properties({'key': 'value'})));\n\n    // Act\n    final result = await mockUseCase.execute(databaseId);\n\n    // Assert\n    expect(result, isA<Success>());\n    verify(() => repository.getProperties(databaseId)).called(1);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis approach gives you the best of both worlds: thorough testing of your actual implementation, and verification that your contract is being used correctly in the broader context of your application.",
