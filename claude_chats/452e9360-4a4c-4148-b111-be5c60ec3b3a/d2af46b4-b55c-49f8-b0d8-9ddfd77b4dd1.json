  "text": " To copy the output of the `tree` command directly to the clipboard on macOS, you can use the `pbcopy` command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ntree /path/to/directory | pbcopy\n```\n\nThis command will run `tree` on the specified directory and pipe the output directly to `pbcopy`, which copies it to the clipboard.\n\nIf you want to include hidden files and directories, you can use the `-a` option:\n\n```bash\ntree -a /path/to/directory | pbcopy\n```\n\nIf you want to limit the depth of the tree, you can use the `-L` option followed by the number of levels you want to display:\n\n```bash\ntree -L 2 /path/to/directory | pbcopy\n```\n\nIf you're using one of the alternative methods I mentioned earlier (because you don't have `tree` installed), you can still pipe the output to `pbcopy`. For example:\n\n```bash\nfind /path/to/directory -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g' | pbcopy\n```\n\nAfter running any of these commands, the tree structure will be in your clipboard, ready to be pasted wherever you need it.",
