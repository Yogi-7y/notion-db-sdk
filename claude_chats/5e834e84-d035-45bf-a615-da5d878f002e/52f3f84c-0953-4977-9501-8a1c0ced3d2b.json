  "text": " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's reassess the situation based on the new information you've provided:\n\n1. If you're able to get the correct response at a breakpoint, then the mock is indeed set up correctly and is returning the expected value.\n\n2. You're correct that if it were returning null, the expect statements would fail. Since they're not failing, the problem likely lies elsewhere.\n\nGiven this information, let's consider other potential causes for the error:\n\n1. Asynchronous execution: The error message suggests that the test is trying to use a null value where a Future is expected. This could happen if the test is completing before the asynchronous operations have finished.\n\n2. Error in error handling: The error might be occurring in the error handling or reporting mechanism of the test framework.\n\nTo address these possibilities, let's try the following modifications:\n\n1. Ensure the test is properly awaiting all asynchronous operations:\n\n```dart\ntest('return the map of properties when response is successful', () async {\n  final _success = Success<Map<String, Object?>, ApiException>(_payload);\n\n  when(\n    () => mockApiClient.call<Map<String, Object?>>(any()),\n  ).thenAnswer((_) async => _success);\n\n  final _result = await repository.getPageProperties('');\n\n  // Wait for any microtasks to complete\n  await Future<void>.delayed(Duration.zero);\n\n  expect(_result, isA<Success<List<Map<String, Property<Object?>>>, ApiException>>());\n  \n  final resultValue = _result.valueOrNull;\n  expect(resultValue, isNotNull);\n  \n  // Add more granular assertions here\n  expect(resultValue!.length, equals(2));\n  expect(resultValue[0]['Description'], isA<Text>());\n  expect(resultValue[0]['Number'], isA<Number>());\n  expect(resultValue[1]['Date'], isA<Date>());\n});\n```\n\n2. Wrap the test body in a try-catch to see if there's an error being swallowed:\n\n```dart\ntest('return the map of properties when response is successful', () async {\n  try {\n    // ... (test body here)\n  } catch (e, stackTrace) {\n    print('Error occurred: $e');\n    print('Stack trace: $stackTrace');\n    rethrow;\n  }\n});\n```\n\n3. Verify that the `getPageProperties` method in `NotionRepository` is correctly handling the async operation:\n\n```dart\nclass NotionRepository implements Repository {\n  // ...\n\n  @override\n  Future<Result<List<Map<String, Property<Object?>>>, ApiException>> getPageProperties(String databaseId) async {\n    try {\n      final request = FetchPropertiesRequest(databaseId: databaseId);\n      final result = await apiClient.call<Map<String, Object?>>(request);\n      \n      return result.map((value) {\n        final List<Map<String, Property<Object?>>> properties = [];\n        \n        for (final page in (value['results'] as List<dynamic>)) {\n          final pageProperties = <String, Property<Object?>>{};\n          final props = page['properties'] as Map<String, dynamic>;\n          \n          for (final entry in props.entries) {\n            pageProperties[entry.key] = PropertyFactory()(entry.value as Map<String, Object?>);\n          }\n          \n          properties.add(pageProperties);\n        }\n        \n        return properties;\n      });\n    } catch (e) {\n      return Failure(ApiException('Failed to get page properties: $e'));\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Ensure that the `PropertyFactory` is correctly implemented and can handle all property types in the payload.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to identify the root cause of the error. If the problem persists, please provide the implementation of the `NotionRepository.getPageProperties` method and the `PropertyFactory` class, as the issue might be in how the response is being processed.",
