  "text": " To rename a word consistently across an entire file in Vim, you can use the following command:\n\n```\n:%s/oldword/newword/g\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of this command:\n\n- `:%s` - This tells Vim to perform a substitution (`:s`) across all lines in the file (`%`)\n- `/oldword/newword/` - This specifies the old word to replace and the new word to replace it with\n- `g` - This flag tells Vim to replace all occurrences on each line, not just the first one\n\nIf you want to confirm each replacement, you can add the `c` flag:\n\n```\n:%s/oldword/newword/gc\n```\n\nThis will prompt you for confirmation before each replacement.\n\nIf you want to match whole words only (to avoid replacing parts of larger words), you can use word boundaries:\n\n```\n:%s/\\<oldword\\>/newword/g\n```\n\nThe `\\<` and `\\>` represent word boundaries.\n\nRemember to replace \"oldword\" with the word you want to replace, and \"newword\" with its replacement.\n\nWould you like me to explain or break down this command further?",
