  "text": " You're right to ask about `program` and `cwd` (current working directory). These are important parameters that can be added to the launch configurations for more specific control. Let's update the `launch.json` file to include these:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Flutter (Debug Mode)\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"flutterMode\": \"debug\",\n            \"program\": \"lib/main.dart\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Flutter (Profile Mode)\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"flutterMode\": \"profile\",\n            \"program\": \"lib/main.dart\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Flutter (Release Mode)\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"flutterMode\": \"release\",\n            \"program\": \"lib/main.dart\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Flutter: Attach to Device\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Flutter Tests\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"program\": \"test/\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nHere's what these additions mean:\n\n1. `program`: This specifies the Dart file that should be run when the debug session starts. For most Flutter apps, this will be `lib/main.dart`. For the test configuration, it points to the `test/` directory.\n\n2. `cwd`: This stands for \"current working directory\". It sets the working directory for the debug session. `${workspaceFolder}` is a VS Code variable that represents the root folder of your project.\n\nThese additions provide more explicit control over what's being run and where it's being run from. They can be particularly useful if:\n\n- Your main entry point is not `lib/main.dart`\n- You have multiple entry points for different configurations\n- You're working with a monorepo or a non-standard project structure\n\nFor example, if you have different entry points for different flavors of your app, you might have configurations like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"Flutter Dev\",\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\n    \"type\": \"dart\",\n    \"flutterMode\": \"debug\",\n    \"program\": \"lib/main_dev.dart\",\n    \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Flutter Prod\",\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\n    \"type\": \"dart\",\n    \"flutterMode\": \"debug\",\n    \"program\": \"lib/main_prod.dart\",\n    \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n}\n```\n\nRemember, for most standard Flutter projects, the default behavior (without specifying `program` and `cwd`) will work fine. But including these parameters gives you more flexibility and control when needed.",
