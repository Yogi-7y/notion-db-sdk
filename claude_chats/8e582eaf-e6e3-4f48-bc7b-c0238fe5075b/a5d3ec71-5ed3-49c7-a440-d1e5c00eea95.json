  "text": " Certainly! Here's a `launch.json` file configured to run the example app in your Flutter project:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Example App (Debug Mode)\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"flutterMode\": \"debug\",\n            \"program\": \"package/example/lib/main.dart\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/package/example\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Example App (Profile Mode)\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"flutterMode\": \"profile\",\n            \"program\": \"package/example/lib/main.dart\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/package/example\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Example App (Release Mode)\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"flutterMode\": \"release\",\n            \"program\": \"package/example/lib/main.dart\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/package/example\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Package Tests\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"program\": \"package/test/\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/package\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis `launch.json` file includes four configurations:\n\n1. **Example App (Debug Mode)**: Runs the example app in debug mode.\n2. **Example App (Profile Mode)**: Runs the example app in profile mode for performance analysis.\n3. **Example App (Release Mode)**: Runs the example app in release mode.\n4. **Package Tests**: Runs the tests for your package.\n\nThe key points in this configuration are:\n\n- The `program` path for the example app is set to `package/example/lib/main.dart`, which should be the entry point of your example app.\n- The `cwd` (current working directory) for the example app is set to `${workspaceFolder}/package/example`, which is the root of your example app.\n- For running tests, the `program` is set to `package/test/`, and the `cwd` is set to `${workspaceFolder}/package`.\n\nTo use this configuration:\n\n1. In your project root, create a `.vscode` folder if it doesn't already exist.\n2. Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a file named `launch.json`.\n3. Paste the above JSON into the `launch.json` file.\n\nNow, when you go to the Run and Debug view in VS Code, you'll see these configurations available in the dropdown at the top of the sidebar. You can select the configuration you want and start debugging by clicking the play button or pressing F5.\n\nRemember to adjust the paths if your project structure is different from what I've assumed based on the directory structure you provided.",
