  "text": " Based on the provided README and diagram, I can offer the following understanding of the project:\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\n1. Purpose: This project appears to be a type-safe structured way to interact with Notion APIs, focusing on handling structured data from within Notion databases.\n\n2. Architecture: The project is organized into two main layers:\n\n   a. Domain Layer:\n   - Contains interfaces and core domain models.\n   - Key components:\n     - Repository interface\n     - NotionClient\n     - Property<T> (abstract class)\n     - Specific property types (Checkbox, Number, Title) extending Property<T>\n     - PostableProperty interface\n\n   b. Data Layer:\n   - Implements the domain layer interfaces.\n   - Key components:\n     - NotionRepository (implements Repository interface)\n     - PropertyFactory\n     - Specific adapters for each property type (CheckboxJsonAdapter, NumberJsonAdapter, TitleJsonAdapter)\n\n3. Key Concepts:\n   - The NotionClient is composed with a Repository, suggesting a clean separation of concerns.\n   - Properties are abstracted, allowing for type-safe handling of different Notion property types.\n   - The PropertyFactory in the data layer is responsible for creating the appropriate Property adapter based on the JSON input.\n   - The project seems to use a factory pattern for creating properties and an adapter pattern for JSON conversion.\n\n4. Limitations:\n   - The client only handles structured data and ignores embedded styles, page blocks, etc.\n\n5. Implementation Details:\n   - The NotionRepository implements the getProperties method defined in the domain layer.\n   - PropertyFactory takes in JSON and returns the appropriate Property adapter, which is then passed to the domain layer.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\nThis project appears to be a well-structured, type-safe way to interact with Notion's database API. It separates concerns between the domain and data layers, which allows for easier testing and maintenance. The use of abstract classes and interfaces suggests that it's designed to be extensible, potentially allowing for easy addition of new property types in the future.\n\nThe focus on structured data from databases, while ignoring other Notion features like embedded styles and page blocks, indicates that this client is specialized for data-centric applications. This could be particularly useful for projects that need to integrate Notion as a data source or for building data analysis tools on top of Notion databases.\n\nThe architecture also suggests good security practices by encapsulating the API secret within the NotionClient and not exposing it directly to the rest of the application.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this project or its architecture?",
