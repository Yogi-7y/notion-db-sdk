My capabilities are limited to analyzing and discussing the information that you provide directly in our conversation. \n\nIf you'd like me to review or comment on specific code, the best approach would be to paste the relevant code snippets directly into our conversation. You can format code by enclosing it in triple backticks (```) for better readability.\n\nAlternatively, you could describe the specific parts of the code or functionality you're interested in, and I'd be happy to provide insights, suggestions, or answer questions based on the information you share.\n\nIs there a particular aspect of the code or functionality you'd like to discuss or have me analyze?",
