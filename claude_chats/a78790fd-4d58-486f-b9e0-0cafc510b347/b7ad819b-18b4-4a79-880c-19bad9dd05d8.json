  "text": " Certainly! I'll provide you with both a shell script (for Unix-based systems like macOS or Linux) and a PowerShell script (for Windows) to rename the files from `*_json_adapter.dart` to `*_model.dart`. These scripts will be more efficient and don't require Dart to run.\n\n1. Shell script (for macOS/Linux):\n\nSave this as `rename_adapters.sh`:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Navigate to the directory containing the files (adjust this path as needed)\ncd ./lib/src/module/data/adapters/property_variants\n\n# Rename the files\nfor file in *_json_adapter.dart; do\n    newname=\"${file/_json_adapter.dart/_model.dart}\"\n    mv \"$file\" \"$newname\"\n    echo \"Renamed: $file to $newname\"\ndone\n\necho \"File renaming complete.\"\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n1. Save it in the parent directory of where your adapter files are located.\n2. Make it executable: `chmod +x rename_adapters.sh`\n3. Run it: `./rename_adapters.sh`\n\n2. PowerShell script (for Windows):\n\nSave this as `rename_adapters.ps1`:\n\n```powershell\n# Navigate to the directory containing the files (adjust this path as needed)\nSet-Location -Path \".\\lib\\src\\module\\data\\adapters\\property_variants\"\n\n# Rename the files\nGet-ChildItem -Filter \"*_json_adapter.dart\" | ForEach-Object {\n    $newName = $_.Name -replace '_json_adapter\\.dart$', '_model.dart'\n    Rename-Item -Path $_.FullName -NewName $newName\n    Write-Host \"Renamed: $($_.Name) to $newName\"\n}\n\nWrite-Host \"File renaming complete.\"\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n1. Save it in the parent directory of where your adapter files are located.\n2. Open PowerShell in that directory.\n3. You might need to set the execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process`\n4. Run the script: `.\\rename_adapters.ps1`\n\nAfter running either script, you'll need to update your import statements. Here's a command to find all files that need updating:\n\nFor Unix-based systems:\n```bash\ngrep -R \"_json_adapter\" .\n```\n\nFor Windows (PowerShell):\n```powershell\nGet-ChildItem -Recurse | Select-String \"_json_adapter\"\n```\n\nThese commands will show you all lines in your project that contain \"_json_adapter\", which you'll need to update to \"_model\".\n\nRemember to adjust the paths in the scripts if your file structure is different. Also, it's a good practice to commit your changes to version control before running these scripts, so you can easily revert if needed.",
