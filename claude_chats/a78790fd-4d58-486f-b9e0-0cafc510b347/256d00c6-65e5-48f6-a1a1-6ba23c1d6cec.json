  "text": " Certainly! I can provide you with a Dart script that will rename all the existing files from `*_json_adapter.dart` to `*_mapper.dart`. This script will work in the directory where it's run, so you should place it in the parent directory of where your adapter files are located.\n\nHere's the script:\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:io';\n\nvoid main() {\n  final directory = Directory.current;\n  final files = directory.listSync(recursive: true);\n\n  for (var file in files) {\n    if (file is File && file.path.endsWith('_json_adapter.dart')) {\n      final newPath = file.path.replaceAll('_json_adapter.dart', '_mapper.dart');\n      file.renameSync(newPath);\n      print('Renamed: ${file.path} to $newPath');\n    }\n  }\n\n  print('File renaming complete.');\n}\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. Save this script as `rename_adapters.dart` in the parent directory of your adapter files.\n\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.\n\n3. Run the script using the Dart command:\n\n   ```\n   dart rename_adapters.dart\n   ```\n\nThis script will:\n\n1. Get all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.\n2. Check each file to see if it ends with `_json_adapter.dart`.\n3. If it does, rename it to end with `_mapper.dart` instead.\n4. Print out each renaming operation as it occurs.\n\nPlease note:\n\n- This script will rename all files ending with `_json_adapter.dart` in the current directory and all subdirectories. Make sure you run it from the correct location.\n- It's always a good idea to have a backup of your files before running scripts that modify them.\n- If you're using version control like Git, you might want to commit your changes before running this script, so you can easily revert if needed.\n\nAfter running the script, you'll need to update any import statements in your code that reference these files. You can use your IDE's refactoring tools to help with this process.",
