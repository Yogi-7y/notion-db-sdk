  "text": " I apologize for the confusion. It seems the directory structure in the script doesn't match your project's actual structure. Let's create a more flexible script that will work regardless of the exact directory structure. Here's an improved version of the shell script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Find all files ending with _json_adapter.dart recursively from the current directory\nfind . -name \"*_json_adapter.dart\" | while read file; do\n    # Generate the new filename\n    newname=$(echo \"$file\" | sed 's/_json_adapter\\.dart$/_model.dart/')\n    \n    # Rename the file\n    mv \"$file\" \"$newname\"\n    \n    echo \"Renamed: $file to $newname\"\ndone\n\necho \"File renaming complete.\"\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. Save this script as `rename_adapters.sh` in the root directory of your project (where your `lib` folder is located).\n\n2. Make the script executable:\n   ```\n   chmod +x rename_adapters.sh\n   ```\n\n3. Run the script:\n   ```\n   ./rename_adapters.sh\n   ```\n\nThis script will:\n- Search for all files ending with `_json_adapter.dart` in the current directory and all subdirectories.\n- Rename each file it finds, changing the ending from `_json_adapter.dart` to `_model.dart`.\n- Print out each renaming operation as it occurs.\n\nThis version of the script is more flexible and will work regardless of the exact directory structure of your project. It will find and rename all relevant files wherever they are located within the project directory.\n\nAfter running the script, you'll still need to update your import statements. Here's a command to find all files that need updating:\n\n```bash\ngrep -R \"_json_adapter\" .\n```\n\nThis will show you all lines in your project that contain \"_json_adapter\", which you'll need to update to \"_model\".\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to commit your changes to version control before running scripts that modify your files, so you can easily revert if needed.",
