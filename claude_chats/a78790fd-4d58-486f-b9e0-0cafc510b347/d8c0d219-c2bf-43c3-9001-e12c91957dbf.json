  "text": " Certainly! I appreciate your attention to detail. Let's make that change to improve the clarity and consistency of the test case description.\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\nThe current test case description is:\n\"throws InvalidMapLengthException when map has incorrect structure\"\n\nWe want to change it to:\n\"throws InvalidMapLengthException when map has more than one key\"\n\nThis new description is more precise and aligns better with the actual condition being tested.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\n<PLANNING>\nWe'll update the test case description in the PhoneNumberJsonAdapter test file. This change will only affect the string describing the test, not the test logic itself.\n</PLANNING>\n\nHere's the updated test case in the `package/test/src/module/data/adapters/property_variants/phone_number_json_adapter_test.dart` file:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:package/src/core/errors/exception.dart';\nimport 'package:package/src/module/data/adapters/property_variants/phone_number_json_adapter.dart';\nimport 'package:package/src/module/domain/entity/property_variants/phone_number.dart';\nimport 'package:package/src/module/domain/entity/value.dart';\nimport 'package:test/test.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  group('PhoneNumberJsonAdapter', () {\n    test(\n      'throws InvalidMapLengthException when map has more than one key',\n      () {\n        final _map = {\n          'Contact': {\n            'id': '123',\n            'type': 'phone_number',\n          },\n          'Extra': {\n            'id': '456',\n            'type': 'phone_number',\n          },\n        };\n        expect(\n          () => PhoneNumberJsonAdapter.fromMap(_map),\n          throwsA(isA<InvalidMapLengthException>()),\n        );\n      },\n    );\n\n    // ... (rest of the test cases remain unchanged)\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis change makes the test description more accurate and consistent with the actual condition being tested. It clearly states that the exception is thrown when the input map has more than one key, which is the specific condition that triggers the `InvalidMapLengthException`.\n\nTo ensure consistency across your test suite, you might want to review other similar test cases in your project and update their descriptions if necessary. This will help maintain a clear and uniform testing language throughout your codebase.",
