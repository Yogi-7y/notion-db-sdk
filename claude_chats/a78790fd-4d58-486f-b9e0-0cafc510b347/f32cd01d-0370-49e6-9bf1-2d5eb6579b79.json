  "text": " Certainly! I'll review the code you've provided and compare it with the property types listed in the Notion API documentation.\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\nAfter examining the code in the package/lib/src/module/data/adapters/property_variants/ directory and the corresponding test files, I can see that you've implemented the following property types:\n\n1. Checkbox (checkbox_json_adapter.dart)\n2. Date (date_json_adapter.dart)\n3. Number (number_json_adapter.dart)\n4. Text (text_json_adapter.dart)\n\nAdditionally, in the package/lib/src/module/domain/entity/property_variants/ directory, I can see implementations for:\n\n5. Status (status.dart)\n\nThese implementations include both the data adapters (for parsing JSON responses from the Notion API) and the domain entities (for representing the properties in your application's domain logic).\n\nEach of these implementations has corresponding test files, which is a good practice for ensuring the correctness of your code.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\nTo summarize, out of the property types listed in the Notion API documentation, you have implemented:\n\n1. Checkbox\n2. Date\n3. Number\n4. Rich text (implemented as \"Text\" in your code)\n5. Status\n\nYou have not yet implemented:\n\n1. Created by\n2. Created time\n3. Email\n4. Files\n5. Formula\n6. Last edited by\n7. Last edited time\n8. Multi-select\n9. People\n10. Phone number\n11. Relation\n12. Rollup\n13. Select (although you have Status, which is similar)\n14. Title (although this might be covered by your Text implementation)\n15. URL\n16. Unique ID\n17. Verification\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these unimplemented properties (like Created by, Created time, Last edited by, Last edited time) are typically read-only and may not require the same level of implementation as editable properties.",
