  "text": " I apologize for the confusion. You're right to question the naming convention, especially when following clean architecture principles. Let's review the naming of your `_adapter.dart` files in the context of clean architecture.\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\nIn clean architecture, the term \"adapter\" is typically used for components that adapt external interfaces to internal ones, often sitting in the outer layers. However, you're using these files to convert JSON to Dart objects, which is more akin to data mapping or parsing.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\n<PLANNING>\nTo align better with clean architecture principles and to more accurately describe their function, we should consider renaming these files. Here are some suggestions:\n</PLANNING>\n\n1. `_model.dart`: This naming convention is often used in the data layer to represent the structure of data as it comes from an external source (like an API).\n\n2. `_dto.dart`: DTO stands for Data Transfer Object. This naming is common when you have objects specifically designed to carry data between processes or layers.\n\n3. `_mapper.dart`: This name clearly indicates that the file is responsible for mapping between different data representations (in this case, from JSON to domain entities).\n\nGiven that you're converting JSON to Dart objects, I would recommend using either `_model.dart` or `_mapper.dart`. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- If the files contain classes that directly represent the JSON structure and are used primarily in the data layer, `_model.dart` would be appropriate.\n- If the files contain logic to convert between JSON and your domain entities, `_mapper.dart` would be more suitable.\n\nExample refactoring:\n\nInstead of:\n```\ncheckbox_json_adapter.dart\ndate_json_adapter.dart\nnumber_json_adapter.dart\ntext_json_adapter.dart\n```\n\nYou could use:\n```\ncheckbox_model.dart  // or checkbox_mapper.dart\ndate_model.dart      // or date_mapper.dart\nnumber_model.dart    // or number_mapper.dart\ntext_model.dart      // or text_mapper.dart\n```\n\nIf you choose the `_mapper.dart` naming convention, you might want to structure the classes like this:\n\n```dart\nclass CheckboxMapper {\n  static Checkbox fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {\n    // Convert JSON to Checkbox entity\n  }\n\n  static Map<String, dynamic> toJson(Checkbox checkbox) {\n    // Convert Checkbox entity to JSON\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach clearly separates the mapping logic and adheres more closely to clean architecture principles by keeping the conversion between external data formats and your domain entities explicit.\n\nRemember, in clean architecture:\n- The data layer should depend on the domain layer, not vice versa.\n- Domain entities should be pure Dart objects without any JSON serialization logic.\n- The conversion between JSON and domain entities should happen in the data layer.\n\nBy renaming these files and structuring them appropriately, you'll make your architecture more clear and maintainable, while still preserving the functionality you've implemented.",
